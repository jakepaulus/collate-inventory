# FAQ #

**What do I do if I have forgotten my password or have been otherwise locked out of the application?**

Please see the document called [Password Recovery](PasswordRecovery.md).

**Why do you host a download of the program on your web site if google is hosting the download too?**

The copy hosted by google is for historical purposes and, as a rule, is not built for distribution. For instance, in version 0.9, the ` password_recovery.php ` script is included in the archive hosted by google and there is no documentation letting everyone know to delete this file during installation. The copy hosted at collate.info, however, does not include this file. The file is, instead, made available as a separate download from the PasswordRecovery document.
